title: Managing Boundary for SSH and Database Access
teaser: Learn how to take a blank canvas Boundary deployment and configure it for production usage.
description: |-
  In this track, you will take a blank canvas Boundary cluster, and learn how to get it ready for production. That
  includes configuring auth methods, accounts, users, groups, and roles. You will also learn how to manage targets,
  access to those targets, and how to log in and connect to them. At the end, you will learn how to manage sessions
  with Boundary, and take a tour of the Boundary Admin UI.

  title: Getting Started With Boundary
  teaser: Familiarize yourself with Boundary resources, and set up your first scopes and users.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Boundary is a tool for managing identity-based access for modern, dynamic infrastructure. Just as infrastructure
      itself can be complex, at first glance Boundary can seem complex as well. As a result, it's helpful to understand
      how Boundary organizes security principals and resources, as well as how it allows you define granular
      permissions to those principals.

      In this track, you will learn how to manage all the different principals and resources in Boundary, as well as
      how to leverage those resources to connect to a host via SSH, as well as a Postgres instance via TCP.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      In this challenge, you will learn about the following Boundary resources.

      - Scope: Abstract permission boundary modeled as a container. A scope can contain scopes forming a tree.
      - Organization: Top-level container (scope) which owns zero to many projects and zero to many authentication methods. An organization inherits from scope allowing it to own zero to many groups, roles, policies, targets, host catalogs or credential stores.
      - Project: Child scope of an organization.

      Boundary has already been
      [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/getting-started-install?in=boundary/getting-started)
      for you. A Boundary Controller and a Boundary Worker are also already running.  If you are not familiar with
      installing Boundary, the reference architecture, or concepts like scopes, auth methods, users, accounts, and
      more - check out the [Install and Configure Boundary Track](TODO).

      What are generated resources? When you run `boundary dev` or boundary `database init`, Boundary automatically
      generates a number of resources to make getting started easier. Default scopes, auth methods, user, account, and
      targets are just some of the resources Boundary will generate unless you tell it not to.

      How do you create your first user and login to administer a Boundary deployment that has no authentication
      methods, users, accounts, etc.?

      You will learn that in this track.
  assignment: |-
    This first challenge will focus on *scopes*.

    What are scopes, you ask? Scopes are a foundational part of Boundary. They allow users to partition resources
    and assign ownership of resources to principals. There are three types of scopes within Boundary:

    - *Global (`global`):* There is only one `global` scope. It is the entry point for initial administration/setup and to manage the org scopes.
    - *Org:* Under the `global` scope, you can create multiple org scopes. Orgs are used to hold IAM-related resources and project scopes.
    - *Project:* Under each org scope, you can create multiple project scopes. Projects are used to hold infrastructure-related resources.

    In this challenge, you're going to create an org scope and project scope, without admin or default role creation.
    You're going to specify a role for managing these scopes by selected users in a later challenge.

    In this track you will make use of a the [Recovery KMS Workflow](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/installing/no-gen-resources#recovery-kms-workflow).
    This allows you to use a key specifid to "recover" Boundary, but you can also use it to authenticate to Boundary
    and manage it as a "global" super user. This allows you to authenticate from the CLI or from Terraform in order to
    manage Boundary without any generated resources. The recovery block you will use is located at
    `/root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl`.

    # Setting Up Your Scopes

    While Boundary has been [initiialized](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/installing/no-gen-resources) for you,
    this instance is currently a blank slate. The first thing you'll need to do is create the `HashiCups Engineering`
    org scope inside the `global` scope. Notice that you are skipping the creation of the admin and default roles for
    the scope.  This allows you to more explitly control access to Boundary, rather than use generated resources.

    Create a new org under the `global` scope named "HashiCups Engineering".

    ```
    boundary scopes create -name 'HashiCups Engineering' \
      -scope-id 'global' \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -skip-admin-role-creation \
      -skip-default-role-creation
    ```

    Example output:

    ```

    Grab the org scope ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export ORG_SCOPE_ID=<ORG_SCOPE_ID>
    echo "export ORG_SCOPE_ID=$ORG_SCOPE_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Create a new org under the new org scope named, "HashiCups Web App" using the org scope ID from above, again,
    without the admin or default roles being created.

    ```
    boundary scopes create -name 'HashiCups Web App' \
      -scope-id $ORG_SCOPE_ID \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \

  assignment: |-
    This challenge will focus on the creation of *auth methods*.

    Now that you have your org scope and project scope created, it's time to add an auth method. Auth methods are
    resources that provide a mechanism for users to authenticate to Boundary. An auth method contains accounts which
    link an individual user to a set of credentials and managed groups which groups accounts that satisfy criteria
    and can be used as principals in roles. Auth methods can be defined at either a `global` or org scope.

    First, create an auth method in the `global` scope.

    ```
    boundary auth-methods create password \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -scope-id global \
      -name 'global_auth_method' \
      -description 'Password auth method for global scope.'
    ```

    Grab the global auth method ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export GLOBAL_AUTH_METHOD_ID=<GLOBAL_AUTH_METHOD_ID>
    echo "export GLOBAL_AUTH_METHOD_ID=$GLOBAL_AUTH_METHOD_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Then, create an auth method in the org scope you created in the first challenge.

    ```
    boundary auth-methods create password \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -scope-id $ORG_SCOPE_ID \

  assignment: |-
    This challenge will focus on the creation of *accounts*.

    In the last challenge, you learned how to create auth methods in Boundary. After you set up your auth methods in
    Boundary, you need to create some accounts. You'll start with admin accounts, and will configure other
    types of users in later challenges.

    Accounts represent external notions of a particular entity. Among other use-cases, this mechanism allows for an
    easy way to switch users to new IdPs within the organization deploying Boundary.

    ---

    You'll need login accounts for an admin user for both of your auth methods. You'll use the username `adminuser`
    and the password `adminuser` for both. Both of these values have been placed in your `~/.bashrc` file for you as
    `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to simplify and reduce the possibility of typos.

    ```
    boundary accounts create password \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -login-name $ADMIN_USERNAME \
      -password $ADMIN_PASSWORD \

    This challenge will focus on the creation of *roles*.

    Roles in Boundary manage the permissions given to principals (*users* and *groups*).

    The following describes the four baseline roles you'll need to create to manage resources within the org and
    project scopes created above. These roles are similar to the roles created for you if generation had not been
    skipped during `boundary database init` when executed with the `-skip-initial-login-role-creation` flag, Declaring
    roles explicitly allows you to manage them independently and fully within Terraform or via the CLI. In doing so,
    you can precisely define their access.

    The following example creates 4 roles:

    TODO: maybe use different names for the global / org admin users?

    - To allow anonymous (unauthenticated) users the ability to list scopes and auth methods in the org scope.

    First, create global anonymous listing roles.

    ```
    boundary roles create -name 'global_anon_listing' \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -scope-id 'global'
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    Role information:

      Scope:

        Name:              global
        Type:              global

    <...truncated...>
    ```

    Grab the global anon listing ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID=<GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID>
    echo "export GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID=$GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Then, add the required grants and principals to the global anonymous listing ID.

    ```
    boundary roles add-grants -id $GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -grant 'id=*;type=auth-method;actions=list,authenticate' \
      -grant 'id=*;type=scope;actions=list,no-op' \
      -grant 'id={{account.id}};actions=read,change-password'

    boundary roles add-principals -id $GLOBAL_ANON_LISTING_ID \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -principal 'u_anon'
    ```

    Then, you'll need to create the anonymous listing role for org scope.

    ```
    boundary roles create -name 'org_anon_listing' \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -scope-id $ORG_SCOPE_ID

    Congratulations! You have setup the initial resources in Boundary, and retrieved your first Boundary token. Next,
    you will learn to connect to your first target, before learning about defining different types of users, roles, and

      In this challenge, you will learn about the following Boundary resources.

      - Host: Computing element with a network address reachable from Boundary.
      - Host catalog: Permission boundary modeled as a container containing scopes forming a tree.
      - Host set: Subset of hosts from the set of hosts of the host catalog it belongs to. A host set belongs to one and only one host; therefore, it gets deleted when its host catalog is deleted.
      - Target: Networked service a user can connect to and interact with through Boundary. A target can contain zero or more host sets.
  assignment: |-
    [Targets](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) are Boundary resources that contain
    one or more [host sets](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets). A target allows
    Boundary users to define an endpoint with a default port and a protocol to establish a session. Unless specified
    with a `-host-id` flag, Boundary will choose one
    [Host](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts) in the host set to connect to at random.

    In this challenge you are going to create a host catalog, add a host set with a new host to it, define it as a
    target, and finally - connect to that host via Boundary.

    # TODO: explain the existence of the Boundary worker as that is what they are going to connect to.

    ---

    You will use the project scope you created for this challenge. List the scopes you created for the org.

    ```
    boundary scopes list -scope-id=$ORG_SCOPE_ID
    ```

    You should output similar to the below text.

    ```
    Scope information:
      ID:                    p_E5Hi8BQlJm

          no-op
          read
          update
          delete
    ```

    You should recognize the "HashiCups App" project scope you created in the previous challenge. Currently, there
    are no targets in the scope. You can confirm that with the following command.

    ```
    boundary targets list -scope-id=$PROJECT_SCOPE_ID
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    No targets found
    ```

    At the end of this challenge, you will have a target that you can connect to, but first, you must configure
    a few things.

    The first thing you'll need to create is a *host catalog* named "HashiCups App" in the "HashiCups App" project
    scope.

    ```
    boundary host-catalogs create static \
      -scope-id=$PROJECT_SCOPE_ID \

    Grab the host catalog ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export HOST_CATALOG_ID=<HOST_CATALOG_ID>
    ```

    Next, create a new *host*.

    TODO: Explain that `boundary-worker` resolves to the extra host.

    Grab the host ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export WORKER_HOST_ID=<WORKER_HOST_ID>
    ```

    A *host set* groups together hosts, which provide logically equivalent services. Targets work off of host sets,
    so even if there is only one hosts, you will still create a host set to contain one host.

    Create a host set named "test-machines".

    ```
    boundary host-sets create static \
      -name="test-machines" \
      -description="Test machine host set" \
      -host-catalog-id=$HOST_CATALOG_ID
    ```

    Example output:

    Grab the host set ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export HOST_SET_ID=<HOST_SET_ID>
    ```

    Now you can add the hosts you created above to the host set.

    ```
    boundary host-sets add-hosts \
      -id=$HOST_SET_ID \
      -host=$WORKER_HOST_ID
    ```

    With the hosts added to the host set and the host catalog, it's time to define the target that you will ultimately
    connect to. You'll create a target named "tests", set the default port to `22` for SSH, and set the session
    connection limit to `-1`, which allows unlimited connections.

    ```
    boundary targets create tcp \
      -name="tests" \
      -description="Test SSH target" \
      -default-port=22 \
      -scope-id=$PROJECT_SCOPE_ID \
      -session-connection-limit="-1"

    Grab the target ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export TARGET_ID=<TARGET_ID>

    The last bit of configuration you'll need to complete is adding the host set you created above to the target you
    just created.

    You are ready to connect to the target. You can paste the target ID into the below command to connect.

    ```
    boundary connect ssh -target-id=$TARGET_ID
    ```

    Be sure to respond `yes` when asked if you are sure you want to continue connecting. You will then be dropped
    into the shell for the `boundary-worker`, connecting your SSH session via Boundary.

    You have now successfully connected to your first target using via SSH using Boundary! Next, you'll learn
    how to use Boundary to connect to a Postgres instance using TCP.

      Since you already have learned how to do most of these individual steps, this challenge will be compressed and
      cover the creation of groups, accounts, users, and roles all in one.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge, we'll create a group and one account for one for a single DBA as an example.

    A group in Boundary is a resource that represents a collection of users that are treated equally for the purposes
    of access control. A group is a principal, which allows it to be assigned to roles. Roles assigned to a group are
    indirectly assigned to the users in the group, and users receive all permissions of the assigned roles.

    Groups can be defined at the Global, Organization, or Project scope.

    TODO: for now this uses the recovery-config, but I should fix the admin user to use that.

    ---

    This time, you'll start out by creating a group for the "HashiCups Engineering DBAs" team, under the HashiCups
    Engineering org scope.

    ```
    boundary groups create \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -name="dba" \
      -description="HashiCups Engineering DBAs" \
      -scope-id=$ORG_SCOPE_ID
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    Group information:
      Created Time:        Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:08:58 UTC

      Version:             1

    <...truncated..>
    ```

    Grab the DBA group ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export DBA_GROUP_ID=<DBA_GROUP_ID>
    echo "export DBA_GROUP_ID=$DBA_GROUP_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Once you have the DBA group created, you'll need to create a role that will be attached to that principal. Since
    this is not for admin users, they should have read-only permissions.

    ```
    boundary roles create \
      -scope-id=$ORG_SCOPE_ID \
      -name="postgres-read-only" \
      -description="Role with read-only permission for Postgres."
    ```

    Grab the DBA group ID from the output and store it in an environment variable for later usage.

    ```
    export PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID=<PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID>
    echo "export PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID=$PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    ```
    boundary roles add-principals \
      -id=$DBA_GROUP_ID \
      -principal=$PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID
    ```

    ```
    boundary roles add-grants \
      -id=$PG_READ_ONLY_ROLE_ID \
      -grant="id=*;type=*;actions=read,list"
    ```

    Now that you have the group created, and associated the correct roles with it. It's time to create a login account
    for a DBA user.  You'll use the username `dbauser1` and the password `dbauser1` for both. Those  values have been
    placed in your environment for you as `DBA_USERNAME` and `DBA_PASSWORD`.

    Create the login account.

    ```
    boundary accounts create password \
      -recovery-config /root/boundary-controller-recovery.hcl \
      -login-name $DBA_USERNAME \
      -password $DBA_PASSWORD \

      - Access Automation: Define your perimeter of resources, identities, and access controls as code through Boundary's fully-instrumented Terraform Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. Automate the discovery of new resources and enforcement of existing policies as resources are provisioned.
      - Session Visibility: Security administrators gain monitor and managed the privileged sessions established with Boundary. Export session logs to your analytics tool of choice.

    # Explore the Admin Console

    Boundary's Admin Console provides an easy way to manage resources. Before using Boundary to securely access any
    dynamic infrastructure, you should take a tour of the console to understand all the components.

    TODO: update or remove this based on the direction of the track.

    In this track, Boundary has already been
    [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/getting-started-install?in=boundary/getting-started)
    for you. A Boundary Controller and a Boundary Worker are also already running. To make your initial tour through
    Boundary a little more interesting, Boundary was
    [initialized with generated resources](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/installing/no-gen-resources).

    What are generated resources? Boundary can automatically generate a number of resources to make getting started
    easier. Default scopes, auth methods, user, account, and targets are just some of the resources Boundary will
    generate unless you tell it not to.

    If you are not familiar with installing Boundary, the reference architecture, or concepts like scopes, auth methods,
    users, accounts, and more - check out the [Install and Configure Boundary Track](TODO).

    # Exploring Roles, Principals and Grants in the Admin UI

    Open the Boundary UI tab. You should see a login screen. To access the password for the `admin` user that was
    generated for you, grab it from the environment in the Controller terminal tab.

    ```
    echo $ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ```

    Once you have logged in, you will see the home screen containing all the top level resources in Boundary. Select
    *Roles* in the left sidebar, then select the "Administration" role.

    Notice that `admin` user is listed. *User*, *group*, and *project* are a type of principal which can be assigned to
    roles.

    Click on the *Grants* tab to view the permissions allowed on this role.  Grants represent strings of actions on
    resources: `id=<resource_id>; action=<actions>`

    The grant for Administration role indicates that all actions (`actions=*`) on all resources (`id=*;type=*`) are
    permitted. Refer to the [documentation](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/security/permissions#permission-grant-formats)
    for more details.

    Return to the *Roles* list and select *Login and Default Grants* role.  Click *Grants* to view its permissions.

    A role can have multiple grants defined. Those grants are deleted when the role is deleted. A grant is also deleted
    if its associated resource is deleted.

    Select *Projects* and then *Generated project scope*. Notice that you can see *Sessions*, *Targets* and
    *Host Catalogs*.

    Select *Host Catalogs -> Generated host catalog -> Host Sets -> Generated host set* to view the details of the
    *Host Set*. You can then select the *Hosts* tab to view attached hosts.

    Now that you have taken a tour of the admin UI and understand the generated resources, you are ready to connect
    to your first target via Boundary.
