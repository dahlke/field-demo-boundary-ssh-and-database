# TODO

## General

- Why Boundary?
- Vault Integration?
- Tie this into LDAP?
- Multiple boxes for workers and controllers?
- get rid of `-description` since it doesn't really add a ton of value? or add it everywhere so people know about it?
- Create slides for the workshop
- Review the copy in assignments / notes / teasers / descriptions / add links all over
- Packer images
- Review and update all the example outputs once the content settles
- All the solve scripts assume  you haven't run anything yet, and might error out if so, so maybe check for them  in the bashrc at least at first?
- separate the global / org admin setup stuff and put the admin UI exploration earlier in the track?
- Run track tests and make sure they are consistently working
  -  then standardize using `=` or a space in all the commands
  - standardize scope / recovery-config locations in args
  - standardize  the `USERNAME` vs. `USER_NAME` for users
