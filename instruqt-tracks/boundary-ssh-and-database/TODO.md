# TODO

## General

- Why Boundary?
- Vault Integration?
- Tie this into LDAP?
- Multiple boxes for workers and controllers?
- get rid of `-description` since it doesn't really add a ton of value? or add it everywhere so people know about it?
- Create slides for the workshop
- Review the copy in assignments / notes / teasers / descriptions / add links all over
- Packer images
- Review and update all the example outputs once the content settles
- admin username / password env vars and dba username / password vars to make it easier
- separate the global / org admin setup stuff and put the admin UI exploration earlier in the track?
