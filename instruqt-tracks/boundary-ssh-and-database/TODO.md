# TODO

## General

- Vault Integration? Tie this into LDAP?
- Multiple boxes for workers and controllers?
- Integrate HashiCups, and make it a workshop w/ slides instead of a demo?
- Review the copy in the track / add links all over
- Packer images
- Standardize all the arguments to each function call (using `=` or strings, and wrapping in quotes)
- Update comments in the solve scripts
- Make a note to use the notes for each challenge so I don't duplicate information
